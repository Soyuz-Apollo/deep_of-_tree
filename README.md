# Deep of tree
deet_tree.cpp is a bad example of searching deep of tree because of big computations.
input: 
1st line - N - number of vertices
2nd line - set of vertices parent_0, parent_1, ... , parent_n, parent_i is a i vertex parent and if parent_i = -1 that means it is root.


there are 3 kinds of solving this task. 
So, the first file - deep_tree.cpp - is the worst type of sovling.
